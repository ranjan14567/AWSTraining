CloudFormation
---------------
AWS CloudFormation is an Infrastructure as Code (IaC) service that lets you define, provision, and manage AWS resources in a
declarative, template-based format.

-->"Consistency: Define infrastructure in code"
-->"Automation: Reduce manual work"
-->"Repeatable: Replicate environments easily"

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Tool: Automates the creation, management, and updating of AWS infrastructure.

Declarative Language: Users define desired end states for resources, and CloudFormation handles provisioning.

Template-Based: Uses YAML or JSON templates to specify AWS resources and configurations.

AWS Native: Exclusively supports AWS resources, fully integrated with AWS services.

State Management: Manages state internally, eliminating the need for separate state files.

Stacks and Stack Sets: Organizes resources in stacks for easier management and allows for multi-account and region
deployments with stack sets.

Cost-Free Tool: CloudFormation itself is free; you only pay for the AWS resources created.

Drift Detection: Identifies and reports on resource changes made outside of CloudFormation to ensure resources stay aligned with
the template.

Use Cases:
----------
1. Create EC2 Instances with Security Groups and Elastic IPs

2. Provision S3 Buckets with HTTP Endpoints

3. Set Up VPCs with Subnets and Route Tables

4. Create RDS Databases with Automatic Backups

5. Deploy Lambda Functions with API Gateway Integrations

6.Set Up Elastic Load Balancers and Auto Scaling for Web Applications

7. Deploy IAM Roles, Policies, and User Access Management

Syntax:
aws cloudformation create-stack --stack-name MyStackName --template-body file://path/to/template.yaml
