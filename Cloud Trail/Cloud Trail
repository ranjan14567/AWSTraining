Cloud Trail

•	AWS Cloud Trail is an AWS service that helps us enable governance, compliance, and operational and risk auditing of our AWS account. 
•	Actions taken by a user, role, or AWS service are recorded as events in Cloud Trail.

•	If the IAM user wants to see the event history we need to attach the role (Cloud Trail) to the IAM User
