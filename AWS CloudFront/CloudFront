What is AWS Cloudfront?
-----------------------
AWS CloudFront is a Content Delivery Network (CDN) that speeds up the delivery of web content to users by
caching it at servers (edge locations) close to them, improving load times and performance globally.

AWS CloudFront primarily caches static content like images, CSS, JavaScript, and videos. 
It can also cache dynamic content (e.g., HTML or API responses) if configured with caching policies and headers. 

By default, sensitive or user-specific data and backend logic are not cached. 
Cache behavior is controlled via TTLs, cache behaviors, and origin headers.
