Security Groups and Network Access Control Lists
------------------------------------------------
          Security group

Operates at the instance level

Applies to an instance only if it is associated with the instance

Supports allow rules only

Evaluates all rules before deciding whether to allow traffic

Stateful: Return traffic is allowed, regardless of the rules

                VS

             Network ACL

Operates at the subnet level

Applies to all instances deployed in the associated subnet (providing an additional layer of defences if security group rules are too permissive)

Supports allow rules and deny rules

Evaluates rules in order, starting with the lowest numbered rule, when deciding whether to allow traffic

Stateless: Return traffic must be explicitly allowed by the rules
