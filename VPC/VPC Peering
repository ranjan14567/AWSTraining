VPC Peering
------------
AWS VPC Peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic 
between them privately.

Advantage of VPC peering
-------------------------
--> Low cost since you need to pay only for data transfer.
--> No bandwidth limit.

Disadvantage of VPC peering
----------------------------
--> Complex at scale. Each new VPC increases the complexity of the network. 
    Harder to maintain route tables compared to TGW[Transit Gateway].
--> No transit routing.
--> Maximum 125 peering connections per VPC.
