VPC Peering
------------
AWS VPC Peering connection is a networking connection between two VPCs that enables you to route traffic 
between them privately.

Advantage of VPC peering
-------------------------
--> Low cost since you need to pay only for data transfer.
--> No bandwidth limit.

Disadvantage of VPC peering
----------------------------
--> Complex at scale. Each new VPC increases the complexity of the network. 
    Harder to maintain route tables compared to TGW[Transit Gateway].
--> No transit routing.
--> Maximum 125 peering connections per VPC.

When should I choose VPC Peering?
----------------------------------
Use Case of VPC Peering is appropriate:

VPC Peering is useful for setting up a simple network scenario with a limited number of VPCs. 
In such cases, the direct connections between pairs of VPCs are sufficient to route the traffic.

Also, you can use VPC Peering if your primary requirement is resource sharing and collaboration between 
specific VPCs without the need for a centralized hub.

You need to use VPC Peering if you face challenges in the complex hub-and-spoke model. 
Thus, it is useful for the cases in which we just need a straightforward and direct connectivity 
between two VPCs.
