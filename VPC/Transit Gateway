Transit Gateway [TGW]
---------------------
AWS Transit Gateway is a fully managed service that connects VPCs and On-Premises networks through a 
central hub without relying on numerous point-to-point connections or Transit VPC

A single Transit Gateway instance, consolidating and controlling your organizationâ€™s entire AWS routing 
configuration in one place.

Advantage of Transit Gateway
------------------------------
-->Simplified management of VPC connections. 
-->Each spoke VPC only needs to connect to the TGW to gain access to other connected VPCs.
-->Supports more VPCs compared to VPC peering.
-->TGW Route Tables per attachment allow for fine-grained routing.

Disadvantage of Transit Gateway
--------------------------------
-->Additional hop introduces some latency.
-->Extra cost of hourly charge per attachment in addition to data fees.

When should I choose AWS Transit Gateway?
-----------------------------------------
Following use cases of AWS Transit Gateway:

Transit Gateway is suitable if you need a scalable network architecture to connect multiple VPCs, 
on-premises networks, and remote networks in a hub-and-spoke model.

You should choose the Transit Gateway if You need cross-region connectivity. 
Thus, you can connect VPCs in different regions with Transit Gateway.

You should select Transit Gateway if your cloud infrastructure requires transitive routing. 
So, you can use it to enable the inter-VPC communication even when they are not directly peered.
