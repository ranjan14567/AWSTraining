Transit Gateway [TGW]
---------------------
AWS Transit Gateway is a fully managed service that connects VPCs and On-Premises networks through a 
central hub without relying on numerous point-to-point connections or Transit VPC

A single Transit Gateway instance, consolidating and controlling your organizationâ€™s entire AWS routing 
configuration in one place.

Advantage of Transit Gateway
------------------------------
-->Simplified management of VPC connections. 
-->Each spoke VPC only needs to connect to the TGW to gain access to other connected VPCs.
-->Supports more VPCs compared to VPC peering.
-->TGW Route Tables per attachment allow for fine-grained routing.

Disadvantage of Transit Gateway
--------------------------------
-->Additional hop introduces some latency.
-->Extra cost of hourly charge per attachment in addition to data fees.
