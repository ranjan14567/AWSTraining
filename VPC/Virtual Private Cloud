Virtual Private Cloud
----------------------
•	A virtual private cloud (VPC) is a virtual network dedicated to your AWS account. 
•	It is logically isolated from other virtual networks in the AWS Cloud. You can launch your AWS resources, such as Amazon EC2 instances, into your VPC. 
•	There are no additional charges for creating and using an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) itself.
•	Easy to use and setup: With the help of the AWS Management Console, one can easily and quickly set up AWS VPC. 
•	It also helps you to focus only on creating the application as the process such as Subnets, IP ranges, route tables, and security groups are automatically created.
•	Security: To enable inbound and outbound filtering at the instance level and subnet level VPC provides advanced security features. 
•	Scalability and Reliability: AWS VPC provides a facility of instant scalability so that you can instantly scale your resources up or down, and select Amazon EC2 instance types and sizes that are right for your applications. 
•	It also helps to save the extra cost as there are no upfront costs.
•	VPC allows the user to select IP address ranges, create subnets, and configure route tables, network gateways, and security settings.
•	VPC allows VPC Peering connections with other VPC within the same or different AWS accounts.
•	It provides a feature of security such that the data stored in Amazon S3 can only be accessed from within your Amazon VPC.
•	We can resize the VPC.
•	Max VPC is 5 Per Region. We can increase this limit so that you can have 100s of VPCs per Region.
•	We can create 200 Subnets in one VPC & 1000 Subnets in one region
•	VPC needs a set of IP addresses in the form of a Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) block. 
		For example: the CIDR 172.16.0.0/16 includes all addresses from 172.16.0.0 to 172.16.255.255 — a total of 65,536 addresses. 16 is the netmask.
•	As IPV4 is 32 bit so /16 means , 32-16=16 and so 2^16= 65,536 IP addresses
•	Similarly for /28 means, 32-28= 4 and so 2^4=16 IP addresses.
•	Block sizes must be between a /16 netmask and /28 netmask.
•	Minimum Size is /28 (16 IP Address)
•	Maximum Size is /16 (65536 IP Address)
