Simple Storage Service
-----------------------
•	S3 is a secure, durable, and highly scalable object storage. 
•	S3 is easy to use, with a simple web service interface to store and retrieve any amount of data from anywhere on the web. 
•	This means customers of all sizes and industries can use it to store and protect any amount of data for a range of use cases, such as websites, mobile applications, 
  backup and restore, archive, enterprise applications, and big data analytics.
•	It is a global service
•	Low latency and high throughput performance
•	It is a Safe place to store your files
•	It is object-based storage
•	Durability: AWS claims Amazon S3 to have a 99.999999999% of durability. This means the possibility of losing your data stored on S3 is one in a billion.
•	A single Amazon S3 object can store a maximum of 5 terabytes. 
•	The total volume that an s3 bucket can store is unlimited. If an object size is greater than 5 gigabytes, you should consider multipart upload.
•	S3 Bucket Names must be unique globally.
•	Lifecycle Management
•	Versioning
•	Encryption
•	Secure Your data using Access Control lists & Bucket Policy
•	Bucket ownership is not transferable to another account.
•	When we create a bucket, we choose its name and the AWS Region to create it in. 
•	After we create a bucket, we can't change its name or Region.
•	By default, we can create up to 100 buckets in each of our AW’S accounts. 
•	If we need additional buckets, you can increase our account bucket limit to a maximum of 1,000 buckets by submitting a service limit increase. 
•	There is no difference in performance whether you use many buckets or just a few. (Note: Search Service Quotas in AWS)

•	Storage Tiers: AWS S3 prices per GB-month of storage, and pricing varies according to the storage tier you select. The AWS S3 Standard tier provides instant access with 
  low data retrieval costs, but a relatively high cost per GB. There are lower cost tiers that offer lower cost per GB, but higher cost of data retrieval or delayed data 
  retrieval.

•	Cost per requests: AWS S3 has a cost per 1,000 requests, depending on the request type.

•	Data Transfer: There are extra charges for data transfer from AWS S3 to the Internet, or to certain AWS regions.

•	Management and analytics: AWS S3 charges extra for automating the data lifecycle and moving data automatically to the most optimal storage tiers.

•	Replication: if you set up replication in AWS S3, data transfer and operations performed during replication are charged like regular AWS S3 operations.

Bucket Creation:
•	Amazon S3 Allows people to store objects (Files) in the
“buckets” (Directories)
•	Buckets must have globally unique names
•	Buckets are defined at the region level
