Versioning
-----------
•	Versioning in Amazon S3 is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket. 
•	We can use the S3 Versioning feature to preserve, retrieve, and restore every version of every object stored in our buckets. 
•	It is enabled at the bucket level. 
•	Versioning-enabled buckets can help you recover objects from accidental deletion or overwrite.

Advantages of Versioning:
•	We can recover deleted objects.
•	We can maintain different versions of the file
