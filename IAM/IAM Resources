IAM Resources
*************
1. Users:
An IAM user is an identity with long-term credentials that is used to interact with AWS in an account.

2. Group:
A user group is a collection of IAM users.

Use groups to specify permissions for a collection of users.

3. Roles:
An IAM role is an identity you can create that has specific permissions with credentials that are valid for short durations.

Roles can be assumed by entities that you trust.

4. Policies:
A policy is an object in AWS that defines permissions.

5. Identity providers:
Use an identity provider (Idp) to manage your user identities outside of AWS, but grant the user identities permissions to use AWS resources in your account.

6. Account settings:
Password policy - configure the password requirements for the IAM users.
