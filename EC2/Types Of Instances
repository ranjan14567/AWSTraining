On-Demand Instances:
-------------------------------
Instances that you pay for as and when you need. 
pay-as-you-go” instances, which you can be charged for either by the hour or by the second.
Buy as much cloud computing capacity as you need, whenever you need it, with no long-term commitment.
When you don’t need it anymore, you withdraw your workloads and cancel the instances, increasing or decreasing your cloud capacity as your computing needs change.

Reserved Instances:
---------------------------
Reserved Instances are configured almost exactly like On-Demand Instances.
when you need, you “reserve” instances for either one year or three years. 
Reserved Instances offer pretty significant discounts compared to On-Demand instances.
There are two types of Reserved Instances:  
Standard Reserved Instances, you can only use instances from within one instance family, on the same operating system.
Convertible Reserved Instances, you can use instances from different families and on different operating systems. 
Convertible Reserved Instances give you a lot more flexibility but they’re also slightly more expensive than Standard Reserved Instances.

Spot Instances:
--------------------
Cloud providers need to keep some space capacity available, in case there’s a huge surge in demand from customers — but for much of the time, that spare capacity just sits unused.  
When you buy a Spot Instance, you’re essentially borrowing excess capacity from your cloud provider for a certain period. “Borrowing” is the operative word here. 
If demand goes up and your cloud provider needs that extra capacity, they’ll take it back — often with less than a minute’s notice before your workloads disappear.
