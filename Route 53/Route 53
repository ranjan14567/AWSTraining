Route 53
---------
AWS Route 53 is a scalable DNS service for domain registration, traffic routing, and health checking capabilities.

DNS or Doamin Name System, is the internet service that translates human-friendly domain likes www.example.com into machine readable IP addresses

Default port for DNS service is 53

We can register our domain name in Route 53, GoDaddy, freenon, Hostinger etc.

In Route 53 we have Six Routing Policies
  •	Simple Routing Policy
  •	Latency Routing Policy
  •	Failover Routing Policy
  •	Weighted Routing Policy
  •	Geolocation Routing Policy
  •	IP-based Policy

Simple Routing Policy
---------------------
•	This is the Default Routing Policy. 
•	This is most commonly used when we have a single region that performs a given function for our domain. 
•	AWS Route 53 responds to the DNS queries based on the values in the resource record set e.g. IP address in an A record

Weighted Routing Policy
-----------------------
•	Weighted Routing Policies let us split our traffic based on different weights assigned. 
•	For Example 80% of our traffic to go ap-south-1 & 20% of our traffic to go to ap-east-1

Latency-based Routing Policy
----------------------------
•	Latency-based routing allows us to route traffic based on the lowest network latency for our end users 
(i.e. which region will give them the fastest response time)

Failover Routing Policy
-----------------------
•	Failover routing policy allows active-passive failover configuration, in which one resource takes all traffic when 
it’s available and the other resource takes all traffic when the first resource isn’t available. 

Route 53 health-checking agents will monitor each location/endpoint of the application to determine the 

Geolocation Routing Policy
--------------------------
•	Geolocation routing lets you choose where your traffic will be sent based on the geographic location of your users. 
•	Geolocation routing policy allows geographic locations to be specified by continent, country, or state (only in the US)

IP-based Policy
---------------
IP-based routing gives you granular control to optimize performance or reduce network costs by uploading your data to 
Route 53 in the form of user-IP-to-endpoint mappings.

DNS Record Types
-----------------
The following are the DNS record types that are supported in Amazon Route53:

A Record ( Address Record ): It is associated with an IPv4 address that is used to point a domain or subdomain to specify 
a IP address.

AAAA Record ( IPv6 Address Record ): It is similar to A Record type but it is associated with IPv6 address. 
It associates the name with an IPv6 Address.

CNAME Record ( Canonical Name Record ): It creates an alias to Domain Name that pointing to another domain name. 
It used for setuping subdomains or pointing multiple domain names to the same server.

MX Record (Mail Exchange Record ): It specifies the mail server responses to receiving email on behalf of a domain. 
It is used for email routing.

Benefits And Features Of Route53
---------------------------------
Highly Reliable: Route53 is built using AWS’s highly available and reliable infrastructure. The distributed nature of the 
AWS DNS servers helps ensure a consistent ability to route the end-users to the web application.

Scalable: It automatically scales the resources during large traffic and also handles large queries without the user’s 
intervention.

Easy To Use:  Very user-friendly and easy to configure DNS settings. It can start to answer your DNS queries within minutes. 
Can be mapped easily to any resource.

Health Check: Route 53 monitors the health of the application. If any failure is detected, 
it automatically redirects the user to a healthy resource before the customer can identify the problem.

Flexible: You can decide which policy you want to use at given time.

Simple: Using routing types, Route53 helps to manage traffic globally.

Cost-Effective: Payment is done only according to the services used.

Secure: By integrating it with IAM, the access to Amazon Route53 is secured by giving its permissions to only 
the authorized users.

Mapped With Various AWS Services: It can be used to map domain names to Amazon EC2 instances, 
S3 buckets, and other AWS resources.
