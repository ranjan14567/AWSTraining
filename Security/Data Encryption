Data Encryption
---------------
AWS offers you the ability to add a layer of security to your data at rest in the cloud, providing scalable and efficient encryption features. 

These include:

Data at rest encryption capabilities available in most AWS services, such as Amazon EBS, Amazon S3, Amazon RDS, and AWS Lambda

Flexible key management options, including AWS Key Management Service, that allow you to choose whether to have AWS manage the encryption keys or 
enable you to keep complete control over your own keys

Dedicated, hardware-based cryptographic key storage using AWS CloudHSM, allowing you to help satisfy your compliance requirements

Encrypted message queues for the transmission of sensitive data using server-side encryption (SSE) for Amazon SQS

In addition, AWS provides APIs for you to integrate encryption and data protection with any of the services you develop or deploy in an AWS environment.
