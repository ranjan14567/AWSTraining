Detective controls
-------------------
Detective controls are security controls that are designed to detect, log, and alert after an event has occurred. 
Detective controls are a foundational part of governance frameworks. 
These guardrails are a second line of defense, notifying you of security issues that bypassed the preventative controls.

For example, you might apply a detective control that detects and notifies you if an Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket becomes publicly accessible. 
While you might have preventative controls in place that disable public access to S3 buckets at the account level and then disable access through SCPs, 
a threat actor can circumvent these preventative controls by logging in as an administrative user. 
In these situations, a detective control can alert you to the misconfiguration and potential threat.
