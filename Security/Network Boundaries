Network Boundaries
-------------------
Network boundaries are the limits that define where a network begins and ends.

Network boundaries are also used to protect the network from unauthorized access and malicious attacks.

Network boundaries are important for organizations because they help to secure their networks from external threats.

Without network boundaries, malicious attackers could gain access to sensitive data or disrupt network operations. Network boundaries can be physical or virtual.

This ensures that only authorized users are able to access the network and use its services.

Once the network boundaries have been created, they can be used to protect the network from unauthorized access and malicious activity.

For example, a network boundary can be used to prevent unauthorized devices from accessing the network by blocking their IP addresses.

For example, an ACL can be used to block traffic from certain websites or IP addresses. 
This can help prevent malicious activity from entering the network and ensure that the network runs efficiently.

Types of Network Boundaries
----------------------------
There are several types of network boundaries that can be used to secure an organizationâ€™s network.

Firewall: A firewall is a type of network boundary that is used to protect a network from external threats. 
It works by monitoring incoming and outgoing traffic and blocking malicious traffic from entering the network.

Access Control Lists (ACLs): ACLs are used to control access to the network. They are used to specify which devices and services can access the network and 
which are not allowed.

Network Address Translation (NAT): NAT is used to hide the IP addresses of devices on the network. 
This helps protect the network from malicious attacks and unauthorized access.

Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): VPNs are used to create secure tunnels between two networks. 
This allows users to access the network remotely while their traffic is encrypted.
