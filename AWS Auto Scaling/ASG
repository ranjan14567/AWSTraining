Auto Scaling Group (ASG)
-------------------------
----> AWS ASG (Auto Scaling Group) is a service that automatically adds or removes EC2 instances based
      on demand to ensure your application is always available. 

It helps scale up when more capacity is needed and scale down during low usage to save costs, keeping the right number of servers running at all times.
  •	Automatic Scaling: Scale the number of EC2 instances up or down based on demand.
  •	Maintain Instance Health: Replace unhealthy instances automatically to ensure reliability.
  •	Use Scaling Policies: Set rules for scaling based on metrics like CPU usage or request count.
  •	Ensure Availability: Always keep a defined number of instances running to meet application needs.
  •	Schedule Scaling: Pre-configure scaling activities for specific times (e.g., traffic peaks).
